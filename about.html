            <p style="line-height: 2;">Vijay made his cinematic debut in 1984 with Vetri, directed by his father, S. A. Chandrasekhar. After appearing in Chandrasekhar's films as an child artist, Vijay made his debut as a lead actor with Naalaiya Theerpu (1992) at the age of 18. He followed it with a supporting role opposite Vijayakanth in Sendhoorapandi (1993). Vijay went on to play lead roles in his father's directorial ventures such as Rasigan (1994) and Deva (1995). Most of those films were successful commercially.
              <br><br>
              Vijay's first breakthrough was in 1996 with Vikraman's romance film, Poove Unakkaga. His subsequent films, Vasanth's Nerrukku Ner (1997) and Fazil's Kadhalukku Mariyadhai (1997), were critically and commercially successful. His performance in the latter won him the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Actor. Thulladha Manamum Thullum (1999), where he played a passionate singer gained him the reputation of a romantic hero.
              <br><br>
              Vijay began the new millennium with critically and commercially successful films such as Kushi and Priyamaanavale. The following year, he appeared in three films: Friends, Badri and Shahjahan. All three were box office successes; barring successful ventures Thamizhan, Youth and Bagavathi (all three released in 2002), his subsequent films Vaseegara and Pudhiya Geethai were released. While Vaseegara was a moderate success and received praise for his comic-timing, Puthiya Geethai received negative reviews and underperformed at the box office. The success of his masala film Thirumalai (2003), changed his on-screen persona to that of an action hero. He appeared next as a kabaddi player in Ghilli (2004), which went on to become the most commercially successful Tamil film of the year. His performance as a sword-smith in the masala film Thirupaachi (2005) earned him a special prize at the Tamil Nadu State Film Awards. He continued to achieve commercial success with Sivakasi (2005) and Pokkiri (2007). The latter garnered him a Filmfare Award nomination for Best Actor. Barring Vettaikaaran's box office success, all of his subsequent releases from Azhagiya Tamil Magan (2007), where he played dual roles for the first time in his career, to Villu (2009) were average successes; his 50th film, Sura (2010), managed to recover only its production cost.
              <br><br>
              In 2011 Vijay's career prospects improved after he was praised for his role as a bodyguard in Kaavalan. Velayudham in which, he appeared as a masked superhero was commercially successful worldwide. The following year he appeared in two films: as a college student in Nanban and an army officer in Thuppakki. His performances in both films received positive critical feedback, with the latter earning him a Best Actor nomination at the 60th Filmfare Awards South. He followed that with A. L. Vijay's Thalaivaa (2013) and the multi-starrer Jilla (2014) which was commercially successful. He teamed up with Murugadoss again for the action film Kaththi (2014). The film, which had Vijay playing dual roles as a thief and an idealist, became one of the highest-grossing Tamil films of that year; his performances earned him critics praise. In his next film, Chimbu Deven's fantasy Puli (2015), he featured again in dual roles; it was an overseas success. The following year, he played a police officer in Atlee's Theri. The film had one of the biggest openings in Tamil cinema and was a major commercial success. Vijay's performance won him South Indian International Movie Awards. He played triple roles for the first time in Mersal (2017), his second collaboration with Atlee. In addition to garnering a UK Award for Best Actor, the film collected ₹2.5 billion. Vijay earned positive critical acclaim for Bairavaa (2017) and Sarkar (2018). He also starred in films Bigil (2019), Master (2021), Beast (2022) and Varisu (2023) which received mixed reviews, but became commercially successful.

              Vijay was born as Joseph Vijay Chandrasekhar in a Tamil speaking family on 22 June 1974 in Madras (now Chennai), Tamil Nadu. His father S. A. Chandrasekhar is a Tamil film director and his mother Shoba Chandrasekhar is a playback singer and carnatic vocalist. His father is of Christian descent and his mother is Hindu. Vijay was baptised at the age of 12. Vijay had a sister, Vidhya, who died when she was two years old.
              <br><br>
              Initially attending Fathima Matriculation Higher Secondary School at Kodambakkam, Vijay later joined the Balalok Matriculation Higher Secondary School at Virugambakkam and went on to pursue a degree in Visual Communications from Loyola College. While studying, at the age of 18, he asked his father if "he would launch him".
              <br><br>
              Vijay married Sangeetha Sornalingam, a Sri Lankan Tamil whom he met in the United Kingdom, on 25 August 1999. They have two children. Vijay's son made a cameo appearance with his father in Vettaikaaran (2009) and his daughter portrayed a small role as her father's pre-teen daughter in Theri (2016).
              <br><br>
              On 5 February 2020, the Income Tax Department raided Vijay's residence in Chennai and inquired about potential tax evasion, making note of his investment in immovable properties, which he inherited from the production studio AGS Entertainment. It was reported that Vijay and AGS Entertainment producer Anbu Cheliyan were suspected of undisclosed payments and alleged tax fraud. Nearly ₹65 crore was seized by the officials from Cheliyan's residence. The investigation took place while Vijay was shooting for his film Master in Cuddalore. On 12 March, officials stated that nothing significant was found during the raid. Opponents of the Bharatiya Janata Party accused them of politically targeting Vijay through such raids because he was critical of the them on demonetization and Goods and Services Tax (India) in the film Mersal.
              <br><br>
              On 13 July 2021, the Madras High Court dismissed a writ petition filed by Vijay in 2012 seeking exemption of the Entry Tax for his Rolls-Royce Ghost car that was imported from England. It imposed a fine of ₹1 lakh which was allotted to the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister's Public COVID relief fund. Justice S.M. Subramaniam said that Vijay's fan base considers him as a hero and he was expected to be one instead of a "reel" hero, further calling it an anti-national habit. On 15 July 2021, Vijay filed an appeal against defamatory statements made by the judge against him in Madras High court. On 20 July 2021, Vijay's appeal against the tax exemption case issue and defamatory statements was moved to a different tax bench sector of the court. On 27 July 2021, a two-judge bench of Madras High court stayed the earlier passed order by Judge S.M. Subramaniam that included the critical remarks and also stayed the order of a ₹1 lakh fine amount. On 25 January 2022, the court dismissed and removed the defamatory critical statements made by Judge S.M. Subramaniam against Vijay. On 15 July 2022, the court declared that no fine should be imposed on the car imported by since he had paid the full entry tax before January 2019, closing out the case in the process.
